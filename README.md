# Deepflow

Deepflow is a cozy website where you can focus giving yourself a certain amount of time and listen to lofi-songs. You can also combine ambient sounds with the music. The main purpose of creating this website is that most of the timer on the internet look bad or are just not according to my preference.

## Features

- Timer
